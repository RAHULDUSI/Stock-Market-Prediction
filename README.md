This Stock Market Prediction project focuses on forecasting future stock prices using advanced time-series modeling. The system integrates:

LSTM neural networks for sequence learning

Yahoo Finance API for real-time historical stock data

MinMaxScaler preprocessing

Fallback Linear Regression for short datasets

Interactive Plotly visualizations for trend analysis

The application is fully interactive, built using Streamlit, and supports multi-day forward prediction, real-time charts, and model-based forecasting. This project highlights practical application of deep learning in financial prediction and quantitative analysis.
